When we get merged into it a godly state begins to reign within and when identicality is developed we begin to feel that a peculiar state reflecting a tinge of divine touch prevails over all objects, animate and inanimate. There is such an indescribable outburst of emotional feelings at this point as often drives people, who lack the support of a worthy guru of calibre, to a state of mad ecstasy —  avadhuta — which keeps him entangled in it for ever, putting a permanent full stop to his onward advancement. Now let us ask those who boastfully profess to be the enlightened ones, or gyaani, whether they have ever come across such a state, which in fact is but the beginning of the first chapter of the book of knowledge. If we try to attain this state by applying our force of thought, it will only be artificial and not true and genuine. '"

       "\"But something is essential for the abhyasi also. In the first place he must have full trust in the Master and must fully co-operate with him in every respect. If it is so he will positively go on developing day by day, and begin to feel himself changed and transformed. The state of waking consciousness of the lower type will get transformed, and his journey through higher and higher types of consciousness will be commenced. Usually consciousness is spoken of as of three levels: conscious, sub- conscious and super-conscious. They are however the broader divisions, and there are still innumerable levels of it in each one. The effect of the activities of the lower consciousness settles down upon the sub-conscious mind forming fate. The first thing to be undertaken is therefore the correction of the lower consciousness by right thinking and practice, so that it may itself be converted into force to bring the sub-conscious mind into a state of splendour. This brings us to the state of super-consciousness. If the word super- consciousness is modified as super-sub- consciousness I think it will be easier to understand its further effects. Anyhow, if by the Master's grace we have come up to it, another theme opens for us. We are in a way merged into it in order to bring to our view the aspects higher than this. The word 'higher' refers only to a rarefied state of it and in the same sense it is applied to the spiritual regions and spheres noted down in this connection. In short the various states of consciousness, one after the other, carry us along beyond the Trinity and even beyond Reality. The state of Freedom commences then but it is after a good deal of tiresome journey. When Freedom dawns the fatigue of the journey is over and we do not feel ourselves encumbered with its weight. \""
